--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BETA: ENSURE ADDRESS IS APPROVED FOR DAI ON GAINS.TRADE. THIS WILL BE BUILT IN FOR FULL RELEASE. 
 - The server runs on heroku - during beta any downtime will result in no further positons being opened. 
 - Currently signals should only open for SOL and XRP                                                     
 - Refer to BCUBE Website: SOL Positional Bot.                                                            
 - Refer to BCUBE Website: XRP Short Term Bot.                                                            
 - Default dev_fee 2%                                                                                     
 - Review your capital and percentage to use per position in the .env.                                    

- If you are running this locally, you need to download nodejs, and I suggest Visual Studio Code as well.
- Navigate to the folder you saved these files in and type "node bot" into the console.

- 50 dai
- 5 matic
- Suggested in future 20% of capital per position. Each position should be at least 50 dai aka 250 DAI on account.
- During testing 100% of 50 dai position is useful to test.

## Prior to running: 
1. Create a .env file using the example supplied in .env-example
2. Add your private and public key values to the appropriate environment variables
