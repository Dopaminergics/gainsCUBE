--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BETA: ENSURE ADDRESS IS APPROVED FOR DAI ON GAINS.TRADE. THIS WILL BE BUILT IN FOR FULL RELEASE. 

- MAX 50 DAI PER POSITION SUGGESTED AT PRESENT. E.G. 100 DAI on account and set capital per position to 45-50 (this is a percentage).
- - Suggested in future 20% of capital per position. Each position should have at least 50 DAI.

 - The server runs on heroku - during beta any downtime will result in no further positons being opened.
