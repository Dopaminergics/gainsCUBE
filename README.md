Still in beta. Current suggested account set up:

- 20 MATIC
- 0.3 GFARM
- It should only use 20% of the GFARM per position. You can change this in the env variables if you like.

## Prior to running: 
1. Create a .env file using the example supplied in .env-example
2. Add your private and public key values to the appropriate environment variables
